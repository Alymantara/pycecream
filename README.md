Includes the astropy_stark and pycecream modules.

Easiest to install these from pip using...

'''
pip install pycecream
''' 

This will
automatically install the astropy_stark library.
Some useful functions in here including the option to generate
fake lightcurves to test the code (see the example script below).


A test python script describing the main features is 
available in the "./pycecream_test/test_pycecream.py"
file. I will turn that into a Jupyter note book and 
make it look fancy at some point.

Please also bear in mind that this conversion to python
is still very new so some bugs will likely appear. Please
get in touch with these and I will try to fix them asap.
